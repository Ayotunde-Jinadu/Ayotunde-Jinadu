<h2>Portfolio</h2>

Hi, I'm Ayo and this is my Cybersecurity Portfolio. I am transitioning into the exciting field of cybersecurity, with a focus on Security Operations Center (SOC) roles. I bring a strong foundation in network monitoring, incident response, and security tools and a passion for protecting digital assets. I am eager to contribute to a forward-thinking organization where I can apply my skills, grow in the SOC environment, and make a meaningful impact on its security posture.
